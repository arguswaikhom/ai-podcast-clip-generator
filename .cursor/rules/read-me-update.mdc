# Update README.md file

Everytime while adding a new feature, code flow changes, command changes update the [README.md](mdc:README.md) file for those changes. Put a proper update there considering this codebase will be use by other developers, users of the project, AI models or AI agents.

If something was added before and it's outdated, those info needs to be updated as well.
