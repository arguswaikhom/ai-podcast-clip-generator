# Execute multiple and improve performance

- While performing a list of execution, see if it's possible to perform multiple operations simultaneously to reduce the total time taken to complete.
- Make sure the multiprocess doesn't create any issue like overwriting file content, locking file access, etc.
- If multiprocess is going to create issue, perform one by one.
- Be aware of the system capability to take the full avantage of the system and not overwhelm the system.
