I have a long podcast transcript that spans several hours. Your task is to analyze the transcript and identify the most engaging, high-quality segments that could be compiled into a shorter, viral version of the podcast. One segment should have a total duration between 30 seconds and 70 seconds.

Follow these instructions precisely:

1. Transcript Analysis
- Read and understand the entire transcript. If the transcript is too long, process it in overlapping chunks to preserve context.
- Since the transcript lacks proper punctuation, use conversational patterns (pauses, speaker changes, logical shifts) to identify where a conversation starts and ends.
- If the transcript does not contain any engaging or viral content, return an empty list []. Do not force segment creation.

2. Identifying Engaging Segments
- Select only the most engaging and complete segments that have strong viral potential.
- Segment selection: Look for inspiring or life lessons or philosophical or beautiful quote or funny or emotional or profound content.
- The segment must be self-contained and tell a full story or idea. A viewer must be able to understand it without needing extra context from before or after.
- Important:
    - Do not choose segments shorter than 30 seconds.
    - Do not cut a segment mid-sentence or mid-story. Ensure a natural start and end.
    - The timestamps must be extremely accurate because they will be used for real video editing.

3. Segment Selection & Duration
- Each segment should be between 30 and 70 seconds long.
- Prioritize quality over quantity. It is better to have one or two high-quality segments than multiple weak ones.
- Ensure the segment contains a strong hook, an engaging middle, and a natural ending.

4. Generate a Clickable Title & Description
- Title: Create a short, attention-grabbing title that would perform well on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.
- Description: Write a compelling summary that highlights why this clip is worth watching.

5. Output Format
- Return results in a JSON array.
- If no strong segments are found, return an empty list [].
- Each object in the array should include:

"start": the starting timestamp (in HH:MM:SS format)
"end": the ending timestamp (in HH:MM:SS format)
"duration": the duration of the segment (ensure it is between 30 seconds and 70 seconds)
"title": a catchy, clickable title
"description": an enticing description summarizing the clip
"explanation": a brief explanation of why this segment was chosen
"segment_file": the file name (e.g., "1.txt") from which the segment is extracted
"segment_index": a numerical identifier for the segment
"hashtags": a list of relevant hashtags to accompany the clip

Example: 

[
    {
        "start": "00:12:30",
        "end": "00:13:10",
        "duration": "00:00:40",
        "title": "The Unexpected Twist",
        "description": "Discover the shocking revelation that changed everything in this conversation.",
        "explanation": "This segment has high emotional impact and a surprising twist, making it ideal for viral content.",
        "segment_file": "1.txt",
        "segment_index": 1,
        "hashtags": ["#unexpected", "#viral", "#revelation"],
    },
    {
        "start": "00:50:00",
        "end": "00:50:45",
        "duration": "00:00:45",
        "title": "Industry Challenges Exposed",
        "description": "Explore deep insights into industry hurdles and what’s really happening behind the scenes.",
        "explanation": "This segment contains a clear, well-structured discussion with valuable insights.",
        "segment_file": "2.txt",
        "segment_index": 2,
        "hashtags": ["#industry", "#challenges", "#insights"],
    }
]


Important Guidelines:
- Ensure timestamps are 100% accurate – they will be used to cut the actual podcast.
- Never cut off a sentence or story – select segments with a natural start and end.
- Only include segments that are complete, self-contained and understandable without any extra context.
- Do not output random clips just to meet a quota – return an empty list [] if needed.
- Focus on the best moments – high energy, emotional depth, surprising insights, humor, life lessons, philosophical, inspiring, beautiful quote.

Now, process the transcript and provide only the best possible segments with precise timestamps, titles, descriptions, and explanations.
